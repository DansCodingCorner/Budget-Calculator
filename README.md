Welcome! 

This applicaiton is a simple expense calculator designed to allow the user to input their monthly exppenses 
and to calculate the total amount spent. The app then displays a pie chart detailing the breakdwn of 
expenses.

What I leaarned:
I learned to make use of DOMs, arrays, and modifying CSS properties with this project as well
as the basics of the js Plotly library in order to display the data.
